In 2007 released an animal based CAPTCHA called Asirra, which asked a user to categorise a picture as containing a cat or a dog. At the time (a decade ago!), this simple test was enough to tell human from computer. The [conference abstract](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/) for Asirra states the following:

> We present Asirra, a CAPTCHA that asks users to identify cats out of a set of 12 photographs of both cats and dogs. Asirra is easy for users; user studies indicate it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Barring a major advance in machine vision, we expect computers will have no better than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it. 

Six years later, in 2013, Microsoft must have realised Asirra's time was up. They released 25,000 of the images from the Asirra database to Kaggle, and promoted a competition to see how good a model the general public could make.

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats (1 = dog, 0 = cat). Below is the leaderboard from when the competition closed, 3 years ago. To be in the top 10, you need an accuracy of more than 0.979 on the test data.
